# Lex's Stencil Tutorial

While working out how to use the stencil buffer in [Garry's Mod][gmod] I had
to read a lot of tutorials and then mangle a whole bunch of code to get a
proper idea on what things were actually doing.

This repository is an attempt to distill all that knowledge into a series of
documented runnable examples that I hope will help people, and enrich the
sadly unfilled [Garry's Mod Wiki][wiki].

The examples will make great use of the entity `sent_stencil_test` which is
just a prop that doesn't draw itself by default. You could easily substitute
it for any other entity of your own.
